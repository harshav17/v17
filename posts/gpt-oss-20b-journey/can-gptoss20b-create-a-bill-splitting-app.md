# Can Vibe-Coding Create a production Bill-Splitting App?

I'm exploring whether coding agents can create a production-grade bill-splitting app without me writing code.

## Rules

I am not allowed to write a single line of code.

## Agents

1. OpenCode with GPT-OSS-20B, running on LMStudio through my Mini PC with Quadro RTX 6000.
2. Github Copilot Pro - 10$ per month
3. Chat GPT Codex - 10$ per month

*November 17, 2025*

1. Scaffolded the app with GPT-OSS-20B and OpenCode. It struggled a to generate a simple python app with UV, sometime generating duplicates lines. Might not be worth pursuing, unless I run it in Ralph-Wiggem mode.

2. Used codex to scaffold some basic issues for a bill-splitting app.

3. Used github copilot to finish the app scaffolding issue that GPT-OSS had started.
