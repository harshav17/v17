# Can GPT-OSS-20B Create a Bill-Splitting App?

*August 21, 2025*

I'm exploring whether GPT-OSS-20B can create a production-grade bill-splitting app without me writing code.

## Rules

1. I cannot spend more money than I currently do. At the moment, I have a ChatGPT Plus subscription and a custom PC build with a Quadro RTX 6000.
2. I am not allowed to write a single line of code.

## Approach

To achieve this, Iâ€™ll use GPT-5-level thinking to craft detailed GitHub issues and constrain the open-source model to work solely based on the repository's content.

Setup: OpenCode connected to GPT-OSS-20B, running on LMStudio through my custom PC.

Good luck, GPT-OSS-20B!
