I wanted to explore whether GPT-OSS-20B could create a production-grade bill-splitting app.

Rules:
1. I cannot spend more money than I currently do. At the moment, I have a ChatGPT Plus subscription and a custom PC build with a Quadro RTX 6000.
2. I am not allowed to write a single line of code.

To achieve this, Iâ€™ll use GPT-5-level thinking to create highly detailed GitHub issues and constrain the open-source model to work solely based on the repository's content.

Setup: OpenCode connected to GPT-OSS-20B, running on LMStudio through my custom PC.

Good luck, GPT-OSS-20B!
